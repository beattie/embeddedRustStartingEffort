# embeddedRustStartingEffort
This repo is my initial effort to learn how to create Embedded Rust projects. I expect this repo to be a bit messy and disjointed until I get a better understanding or Rust and more specifically Embedded Rust.
My hardware targets will be a BBC micro:bit V2 and an STM32F3-Discovery.

My efforts will start with and embedded **HelloWorld** using RTT.

* **hello** can be compiled and run with **cargo embed**
* currently I can not reliably set a breakpoint, I've don it so gdb can set one on the micro:bit but I can't seem to do it right now.
